# LanguageTranslator

This is a mobile application that is to help people who would want to learn the french language. 

# Getting Started:
- Make sure you setup https://github.com/margaretmwaura/WebScrapper project as it serves as the backend.
- Since it is a local setup , ensure you have ngrok for tunnelling
- Run ./ngrok http 192.168.10.10:80 -host-header=french.appp  in your terminal. Make sure you run it where your ngrok file is at. The french.appp is the name
of the local setup of your app, the webscrapper. One is free to change the name.
